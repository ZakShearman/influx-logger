# influx-logger
A metrics logger for sending statistics to InfluxDB v2 simply

Influx logger is meant to be a simple way of sending metrics from Java to InfluxDB v2.
This used to be an internal tool part of an abandoned project so it got a spruce up and open source for anyone that would find it useful.

Thanks to Hyfe for the original code up. NGL most of the work originally done by them.
